# First_Phase_HTML_And_CSS_Only
 
This was the first phase of the project. I was given a design through Figma and I had to build it into a site (using only HTML and CSS without being responsive).
The second phase was to make it responsive using @media.
The third phase was to use Tailwind to have the same or better result.

The Figma Design is available upon request.
